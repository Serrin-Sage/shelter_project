# Shelter Project

This project is a recreation of a project I made during my time at Hunter College. The project was focused on finding data on a topic or problem we were interested in solving.
We used Python to generate data and then used that data to support our argument on the given problem. 
I'm recreating this project using Typescript as a way teach and test my ability with TS.
